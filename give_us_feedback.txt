1) How would you rate (1-10) the difficulty level of the test (1 = really easy, 10 = impossible)?

I will classify test on medium 5 level, because have not done any frontend development in last to 2 years, lot to recap.

2) Was the timit limit (7,5 hours) ok or too strict?

It took me more than 7,5 hours, approximately ~15 hours, most of time re-introducing front frameworks and reading about new libraries for me.

3) Other feedback about the test?

Some libraries are outdated, seems to be old assignment. For backend I will recommend Spring Boot base, with flyway to keep track migrations.
Also tried same assignment with JHipster took 30 minutes, to cover functionality. Testing with Mocha seemed interesting
, how it is used on SI servers in that way? I would prefer java selenium test instead in this kind of setup.
